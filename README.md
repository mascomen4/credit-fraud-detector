# credit-fraud-detector
This is repository for ML practice after I finished the stepik course. Data taken from https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann/credit-fraud-dealing-with-imbalanced-datasets

# Our Goals:
Understand the little distribution of the "little" data that was provided to us.
Create a 50/50 sub-dataframe ratio of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions. (NearMiss Algorithm)
Determine the Classifiers we are going to use and decide which one has a higher accuracy.
Create a Neural Network and compare the accuracy to our best classifier.
Understand common mistaked made with imbalanced datasets.
